        <h3>About Algeria Forest Fires</h3>
        <p>
            Algeria is known for its expansive forest areas that are vulnerable to wildfires due to dry and hot conditions. Forest fires in Algeria have caused significant environmental and economic damage over the years. The Forest Weather Index (FWI) is a key indicator used to predict and assess the risk of forest fires by measuring the potential danger based on weather conditions.

        <h3>Why Predict FWI?</h3>
        <p>
            Predicting the Forest Weather Index (FWI) is crucial in preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires. By forecasting FWI, authorities can take proactive measures to reduce the risk of fire outbreaks. This can help in deploying resources, alerting the public, and taking steps to prevent forest degradation and loss of biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
            With accurate predictions of FWI using machine learning models like Ridge Regression, we can enhance the accuracy of fire risk predictions. This ultimately aids in ensuring safer communities, better resource management, and preserving forest ecosystems.
